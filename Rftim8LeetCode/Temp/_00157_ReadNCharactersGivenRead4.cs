        /// Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method to read n characters.
        /// 
        /// Method read4:
        /// 
        /// The API read4 reads four consecutive characters from file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf4.
        /// 
        /// The return value is the number of actual characters read.
        /// 
        /// Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE* fp in C.
        /// 
        /// Definition of read4:
        /// 
        ///     Parameter:  char[] buf4
        ///     Returns:    int
        /// 
        /// buf4[] is a destination, not a source.The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].
        /// Below is a high-level example of how read4 works:
        /// File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
        /// char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
        /// read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
        /// read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
        /// read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file
        /// 
        /// 
        /// Method read:
        /// 
        /// By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from file and store it in the buffer array buf.
        /// Consider that you cannot manipulate file directly.
        /// 
        /// The return value is the number of actual characters read.
        /// 
        /// Definition of read:
        /// 
        ///     Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
        ///     Returns:	int
        ///

        /// Note:
        /// 
        /// Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. 
        /// The file is only accessible for read4 but not for read.
        /// The read function will only be called once for each test case.
        /// You may assume the destination buffer array, buf, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing n characters.
