        /// If a word begins with a vowel('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append "ma" to the end of the word.
        /// For example, the word "apple" becomes "applema".
        /// If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
        /// For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
        /// Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
        /// For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end, and so on.
