        /// Spin, written sX, makes X programs move from the end to the front, but maintain their order otherwise. (For example, s3 on abcde produces cdeab).
        /// Exchange, written xA/B, makes the programs at positions A and B swap places.
        /// Partner, written pA/B, makes the programs named A and B swap places.
        /// For example, with only five programs standing in a line (abcde), they could do the following dance:
        /// 
        /// s1, a spin of size 1: eabcd.
