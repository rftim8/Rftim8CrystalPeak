        /// After a weird buzzing noise, you appear back at the man's cottage. He seems relieved to see his friend,

        /// 
        /// The portly man explains that this reindeer's immune system isn't similar to regular reindeer immune systems:
        /// 
        /// The immune system and the infection each have an army made up of several groups; each group consists of one or more identical units. 
        /// The armies repeatedly fight until only one army has units remaining.
        /// 
        /// Units within a group all have the same hit points (amount of damage a unit can take before it is destroyed), attack damage(the amount of damage each unit deals), 
        /// an attack type, an initiative(higher initiative units attack first and win ties), and sometimes weaknesses or immunities.Here is an example group:
        /// 
        /// 18 units each with 729 hit points(weak to fire; immune to cold, slashing)
        ///  with an attack that does 8 radiation damage at initiative 10
        /// Each group also has an effective power: the number of units in that group multiplied by their attack damage.
        /// The above group has an effective power of 18 * 8 = 144. Groups never have zero or negative units; instead, the group is removed from combat.
        /// Each fight consists of two phases: target selection and attacking.
        /// During the target selection phase, each group attempts to choose one target.In decreasing order of effective power, groups choose their targets; 
        /// in a tie, the group with the higher initiative chooses first.The attacking group chooses to target the group in the enemy army 
        /// to which it would deal the most damage(after accounting for weaknesses and immunities, 
        /// but not accounting for whether the defending group has enough units to actually receive all of that damage).
        /// 
        /// If an attacking group is considering two defending groups to which it would deal equal damage, it chooses to target the defending group 
        /// with the largest effective power; if there is still a tie, it chooses the defending group with the highest initiative.
        /// If it cannot deal any defending groups damage, it does not choose a target.Defending groups can only be chosen as a target by one attacking group.
        ///         At the end of the target selection phase, each group has selected zero or one groups to attack, and each group is being attacked by zero or one groups.
        /// 
        /// During the attacking phase, each group deals damage to the target it selected, if any.Groups attack in decreasing order of initiative, 
        /// regardless of whether they are part of the infection or the immune system. (If a group contains no units, it cannot attack.)
        /// 
        /// The damage an attacking group deals to a defending group depends on the attacking group's attack type and the defending group's immunities and weaknesses.
        /// By default, an attacking group would deal damage equal to its effective power to the defending group.
        /// However, if the defending group is immune to the attacking group's attack type, the defending group instead takes no damage; 
        /// if the defending group is weak to the attacking group's attack type, the defending group instead takes double damage.
        /// 
        /// The defending group only loses whole units from damage; damage is always dealt in such a way that it kills the most units possible, 
        /// and any remaining damage to a unit that does not immediately kill it is ignored.For example, 
        /// if a defending group contains 10 units with 10 hit points each and receives 75 damage, it loses exactly 7 units and is left with 3 units at full health.
        ///         After the fight is over, if both armies still contain units, a new fight begins; combat only ends once one army has lost all of its units.
        ///         For example, consider the following armies:
        /// 
        /// Immune System:
        /// 17 units each with 5390 hit points (weak to radiation, bludgeoning) with
