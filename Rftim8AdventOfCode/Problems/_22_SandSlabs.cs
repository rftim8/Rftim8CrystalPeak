        /// The position is given as two x, y, z coordinates - one for each end of the brick - separated by a tilde (~). 
        /// Each brick is made up of a single straight line of cubes, and the Elves were even careful to choose a time for the snapshot 
        /// that had all of the free-falling bricks at integer positions above the ground, so the whole snapshot is aligned to a 
        /// three-dimensional cube grid.
        /// A line like 2,2,2~2,2,2 means that both ends of the brick are at the same coordinate - in other words, 
        /// that the brick is a single cube.
        /// Lines like 0,0,10~1,0,10 or 0,0,10~0,1,10 both represent bricks that are two cubes in volume, both oriented horizontally.
        /// The first brick extends in the x direction, while the second brick extends in the y direction.
        /// A line like 0,0,1~0,0,10 represents a ten-cube brick which is oriented vertically.

        ///

        /// supported on one end. Two bricks cannot occupy the same position, so a falling brick will come to rest upon the first other
