        /// The cups will be arranged in a circle and labeled clockwise(your puzzle input). 
        /// For example, if your labeling were 32415, there would be five cups in the circle; going clockwise around the circle from the first cup,
        /// the cups would be labeled 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, and then back to 3 again.

        /// 
        /// The crab picks up the three cups that are immediately clockwise of the current cup.They are removed from the circle; 
        /// cup spacing is adjusted as necessary to maintain the circle.

        /// If this would select one of the cups that was just picked up, the crab will keep subtracting one until it finds a cup that wasn't just picked up.
        /// If at any point in this process the value goes below the lowest value on any cup's label, it wraps around to the highest value on any cup's label instead.
