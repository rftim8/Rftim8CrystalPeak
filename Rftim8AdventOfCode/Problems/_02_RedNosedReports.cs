        /// In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:
        /// 
        /// 7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.
        /// 1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.
        /// 9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4.
        /// 1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3 is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing.
        /// 8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a decrease.
        /// 1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.
