        /// and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.
        /// 
        /// The submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, 
        /// it offers a polymer template and a list of pair insertion rules(your puzzle input). 
        /// You just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.
        /// For example:
        /// 
        /// NNCB
        /// 
        /// CH -> B
        /// HH -> N
        /// CB -> H
        /// NH -> C
        /// HB -> C
        /// HC -> B
        /// HN -> C
        /// NN -> C
        /// BH -> H
        /// NC -> B
        /// NB -> B
        /// BN -> B
        /// BB -> N
        /// BC -> B
        /// CC -> N
        /// CN -> C
        /// The first line is the polymer template - this is the starting point of the process.
        /// The following section defines the pair insertion rules.A rule like AB -> C means that when elements A and B are immediately adjacent,
        /// element C should be inserted between them.These insertions all happen simultaneously.
        /// 
        /// So, starting with the polymer template NNCB, the first step simultaneously considers all three pairs:
        /// 
        /// The first pair (NN) matches the rule NN -> C, so element C is inserted between the first N and the second N.
        /// The second pair (NC) matches the rule NC -> B, so element B is inserted between the N and the C.
        /// The third pair (CB) matches the rule CB -> H, so element H is inserted between the C and the B.
        /// Note that these pairs overlap: the second element of one pair is the first element of the next pair.
        /// Also, because all pairs are considered simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered to be part of a pair until the next step.
        /// After the first step of this process, the polymer becomes NCNBCHB.
        /// 
        /// Here are the results of a few steps using the above rules:
        /// 
        /// Template:     NNCB
        /// After step 1: NCNBCHB
        /// After step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
        /// After step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB
        /// After step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB
        /// This polymer grows quickly.After step 5, it has length 97; After step 10, it has length 3073. 
        /// After step 10, B occurs 1749 times, C occurs 298 times, H occurs 161 times, and N occurs 865 times; 
        /// taking the quantity of the most common element(B, 1749) and subtracting the quantity of the least common element(H, 161) produces 1749 - 161 = 1588.
