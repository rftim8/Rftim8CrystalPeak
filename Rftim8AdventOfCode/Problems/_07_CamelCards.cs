        /// 
        /// In Camel Cards, you get a list of hands, and your goal is to order them based on the strength of each hand.

        /// The relative strength of each card follows this order, where A is the highest and 2 is the lowest.
        /// 
        /// Every hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:
        /// 
        /// Five of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: AAAAA
        /// Four of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA
        /// Full house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: 23332
        /// Three of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: TTT98
        /// Two pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the remaining card has a third label: 23432
        /// One pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: A23A4
        /// High card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456
        /// Hands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every full house is stronger than any three of a kind.
        /// 
        /// If two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by comparing the first card in each hand. 
        /// If these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger. 
        /// If the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand. 
        /// If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.
        /// 
        /// So, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger because its first card is stronger. 
        /// Similarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both hands have the same first and second card).
        /// 
        /// To play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid(your puzzle input). For example:
        /// 
        /// 32T3K 765
        /// T55J5 684
        /// KK677 28
        /// KTJJT 220
        /// QQQJA 483
        /// This example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its bid amount.
        /// Each hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2,
        /// and so on up to the strongest hand.Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.
        /// 
        /// So, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:
        /// 
        /// 32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it gets rank 1.
        /// KK677 and KTJJT are both two pair.Their first cards both have the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger(K vs T),
        /// so KTJJT gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3.
        /// T55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind.QQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.
        /// Now, you can determine the total winnings of this set of hands by adding up the result of multiplying each hand's bid with its 
        /// rank (765 * 1 + 220 * 2 + 28 * 3 + 684 * 4 + 483 * 5). So the total winnings in this example are 6440.
