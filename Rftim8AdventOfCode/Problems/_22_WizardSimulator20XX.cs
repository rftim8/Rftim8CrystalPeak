        /// As before, if armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below 1, it becomes 1 instead - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least 1 damage.

        /// Magic Missile costs 53 mana. It instantly does 4 damage.

        /// Shield costs 113 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. While it is active, your armor is increased by 7.
        /// Poison costs 173 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it deals the boss 3 damage.
        /// Recharge costs 229 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 5 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it gives you 101 new mana.
        /// Effects all work the same way.Effects apply at the start of both the player's turns and the boss' turns.
        /// Effects are created with a timer (the number of turns they last); at the start of each turn, after they apply any effect they have, their timer is decreased by one.
        /// If this decreases the timer to zero, the effect ends.You cannot cast a spell that would start an effect which is already active.
