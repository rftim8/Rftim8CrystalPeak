        /// and the floor is cave, and you're pretty sure this is actually just a giant cave.
        /// 
        /// Finally, as you approach what must be the heart of the mountain, you see a bright light in a cavern up ahead.
        /// There, you discover that the beam of light you so carefully focused is emerging from the cavern wall closest to the facility
        /// and pouring all of its energy into a contraption on the opposite side.
        /// 
        /// 
        /// Upon closer inspection, the contraption appears to be a flat, two-dimensional square grid containing empty space (.),
        /// mirrors(/ and \), and splitters(| and -).
        /// 
        /// The contraption is aligned so that most of the beam bounces around the grid, but each tile on the grid converts some of the 
        /// beam's light into heat to melt the rock in the cavern.

        /// You note the layout of the contraption(your puzzle input). For example:

        /// The beam enters in the top-left corner from the left and heading to the right.
        /// Then, its behavior depends on what it encounters as it moves:
        /// 
        /// If the beam encounters empty space (.), it continues in the same direction.
        /// If the beam encounters a mirror(/ or \), the beam is reflected 90 degrees depending on the angle of the mirror.
        /// For instance, a rightward-moving beam that encounters a / mirror would continue upward in the mirror's column,
        /// while a rightward-moving beam that encounters a \ mirror would continue downward from the mirror's column.
        /// If the beam encounters the pointy end of a splitter (| or -), the beam passes through the splitter as if the splitter
        /// were empty space.For instance, a rightward-moving beam that encounters a - splitter would continue in the same direction.
        /// If the beam encounters the flat side of a splitter(| or -), the beam is split into two beams going in each of the two 
        /// directions the splitter's pointy ends are pointing. For instance, a rightward-moving beam that encounters a | splitter 
        /// would split into two beams: one that continues upward from the splitter's column and one that continues downward from
        /// the splitter's column.
