        /// An urgent interrupt arrives from the CPU: it's trapped in a maze of jump instructions, 
        /// and it would like assistance from any programs with spare cycles to help find the exit.
        /// 
        /// The message includes a list of the offsets for each jump.
        /// Jumps are relative: -1 moves to the previous instruction, and 2 skips the next one. Start at the first instruction in the list. 
        /// The goal is to follow the jumps until one leads outside the list.
        /// 
        /// In addition, these instructions are a little strange; after each jump, the offset of that instruction increases by 1.
        /// So, if you come across an offset of 3, you would move three instructions forward, but change it to a 4 for the next time it is encountered.
        /// 
        /// For example, consider the following list of jump offsets:
        /// 
        /// 0
        /// 3
        /// 0
        /// 1
        /// -3
        /// Positive jumps("forward") move downward; negative jumps move upward.
        /// For legibility in this example, these offset values will be written all on one line, with the current instruction marked in parentheses.
        /// The following steps would be taken before an exit is found:
        /// 
        /// (0) 3  0  1  -3  - before we have taken any steps.
        /// (1) 3  0  1  -3  - jump with offset 0 (that is, don't jump at all). Fortunately, the instruction is then incremented to 1.
        ///  2 (3) 0  1  -3  - step forward because of the instruction we just modified.The first instruction is incremented again, now to 2.
        ///  2  4  0  1 (-3) - jump all the way to the end; leave a 4 behind.
        ///  2 (4) 0  1  -2  - go back to where we just were; increment -3 to -2.
        ///  2  5  0  1  -2  - jump 4 steps forward, escaping the maze.
        /// In this example, the exit is reached in 5 steps.
