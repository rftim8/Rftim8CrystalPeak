        /// 
        /// The machines are far apart and wired together with long cables.
        /// The cables don't connect to the machines directly, but rather to communication modules attached to the machines that perform various initialization tasks and also
        /// act as communication relays.
        /// 
        /// Modules communicate using pulses. Each pulse is either a high pulse or a low pulse.
        /// When a module sends a pulse, it sends that type of pulse to each module in its list of destination modules.
        /// 
        /// There are several different types of modules:
        /// 
        /// Flip-flop modules (prefix %) are either on or off; they are initially off.If a flip-flop module receives a high pulse, it is ignored and nothing happens. 
        /// However, if a flip-flop module receives a low pulse, it flips between on and off. If it was off, it turns on and sends a high pulse. 
        /// If it was on, it turns off and sends a low pulse.
        /// 
        /// Conjunction modules (prefix &) remember the type of the most recent pulse received from each of their connected input modules; 
        /// they initially default to remembering a low pulse for each input.When a pulse is received, the conjunction module first updates its memory for that input.
        /// Then, if it remembers high pulses for all inputs, it sends a low pulse; otherwise, it sends a high pulse.
        /// 
        /// There is a single broadcast module(named broadcaster). When it receives a pulse, it sends the same pulse to all of its destination modules.
        /// 
        /// Here at Desert Machine Headquarters, there is a module with a single button on it called, aptly, the button module.
        /// When you push the button, a single low pulse is sent directly to the broadcaster module.
        /// 
        /// After pushing the button, you must wait until all pulses have been delivered and fully handled before pushing it again. 
        /// Never push the button if modules are still processing pulses.
        /// 
        /// Pulses are always processed in the order they are sent.
        /// So, if a pulse is sent to modules a, b, and c, and then module a processes its pulse and sends more pulses, the pulses sent to modules b and c would have to be handled first.
        /// 
        /// 
        /// The module configuration (your puzzle input) lists each module.The name of the module is preceded by a symbol identifying its type, if any.
        /// The name is then followed by an arrow and a list of its destination modules.
        /// For example:
        /// 
        /// broadcaster -> a, b, c
        /// %a -> b
        /// %b -> c
        /// %c -> inv
        /// &inv -> a
        /// In this module configuration, the broadcaster has three destination modules named a, b, and c. 
        /// Each of these modules is a flip-flop module (as indicated by the % prefix). a outputs to b which outputs to c which outputs to another module named inv.
        /// inv is a conjunction module(as indicated by the & prefix) which, because it has only one input, acts like an inverter(it sends the opposite of the pulse type it receives); 
        /// it outputs to a.
        /// 
        /// By pushing the button once, the following pulses are sent:
        /// 
        /// button -low-> broadcaster
        /// broadcaster -low-> a
        /// broadcaster -low-> b
        /// broadcaster -low-> c
        /// a -high-> b
        /// b -high-> c
        /// c -high-> inv
        /// inv -low-> a
        /// a -low-> b
        /// b -low-> c
        /// c -low-> inv
        /// inv -high-> a
        /// After this sequence, the flip-flop modules all end up off, so pushing the button again repeats the same sequence.
        /// 
        /// Here's a more interesting example:
        /// 
        /// 
        /// broadcaster -> a
        /// %a -> inv, con
        /// &inv -> b
        /// %b -> con
        /// &con -> output
        /// This module configuration includes the broadcaster, two flip-flops (named a and b), a single-input conjunction module(inv), a multi-input conjunction module(con), 
        /// and an untyped module named output(for testing purposes).
        /// The multi-input conjunction module con watches the two flip-flop modules and, if they're both on, sends a low pulse to the output module.
        /// 
        /// Here's what happens if you push the button once:
        /// 
        /// button -low-> broadcaster
        /// broadcaster -low-> a
        /// a -high-> inv
        /// a -high-> con
        /// inv -low-> b
        /// con -high-> output
        /// b -high-> con
        /// con -low-> output
        /// Both flip-flops turn on and a low pulse is sent to output!
        /// However, now that both flip-flops are on and con remembers a high pulse from each of its two inputs, pushing the button a second time does something different:
        /// 
        /// button -low-> broadcaster
        /// broadcaster -low-> a
        /// a -low-> inv
        /// a -low-> con
        /// inv -high-> b
        /// con -high-> output
        /// Flip-flop a turns off! Now, con remembers a low pulse from module a, and so it sends only a high pulse to output.
        /// 
        /// Push the button a third time:
        /// 
        /// button -low-> broadcaster
        /// broadcaster -low-> a
        /// a -high-> inv
        /// a -high-> con
        /// inv -low-> b
        /// con -low-> output
        /// b -low-> con
        /// con -high-> output
        /// This time, flip-flop a turns on, then flip-flop b turns off.
        /// However, before b can turn off, the pulse sent to con is handled first, so it briefly remembers all high pulses for its inputs and sends a low pulse to output.
        /// After that, flip-flop b turns off, which causes con to update its state and send a high pulse to output.
        /// 
        /// Finally, with a on and b off, push the button a fourth time:
        /// 
        /// button -low-> broadcaster
        /// broadcaster -low-> a
        /// a -low-> inv
        /// a -low-> con
        /// inv -high-> b
        /// con -high-> output
        /// This completes the cycle: a turns off, causing con to remember only low pulses and restoring all modules to their original states.
        /// 
        /// To get the cables warmed up, the Elves have pushed the button 1000 times.
        /// How many pulses got sent as a result (including the pulses sent by the button itself)?
        /// 
        /// In the first example, the same thing happens every time the button is pushed: 8 low pulses and 4 high pulses are sent.
        /// So, after pushing the button 1000 times, 8000 low pulses and 4000 high pulses are sent.
        /// Multiplying these together gives 32000000.
        /// 
        /// In the second example, after pushing the button 1000 times, 4250 low pulses and 2750 high pulses are sent.
