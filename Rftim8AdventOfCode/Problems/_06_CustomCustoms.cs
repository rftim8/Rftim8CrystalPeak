        /// As your flight approaches the regional airport where you'll switch to a much larger plane, customs declaration forms are distributed to the passengers.
        /// 
        /// The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z.All you need to do is identify the questions for which anyone in your group answers "yes". 
        /// Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.
        /// 
        /// However, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing a language barrier and asks if you can help.
        /// For each of the people in their group, you write down the questions for which they answer "yes", one per line.For example:
        /// 
        /// abcx
        /// abcy
        /// abcz
        /// In this group, there are 6 questions to which anyone answered "yes": a, b, c, x, y, and z.
        /// (Duplicate answers to the same question don't count extra; each question counts at most once.)
        /// 
        /// 
        /// Another group asks for your help, then another, and eventually you've collected answers from every group on the plane (your puzzle input).
