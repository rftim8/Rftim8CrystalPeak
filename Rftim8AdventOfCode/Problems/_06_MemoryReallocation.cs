        /// A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.
        /// 
        /// In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks. 
        /// The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.
        /// 
        /// The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) 
        /// and redistributes those blocks among the banks.
        /// To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next(by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks.
        /// It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.
        /// The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.
        /// 
        /// For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:
        /// 
        /// The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks.The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.
        /// Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks.
        /// The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back.The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.
        /// Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.
        /// Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. 
        /// The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.
        /// The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.
        /// The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.
        /// At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen.
        /// The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.
        /// 
        /// Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?
