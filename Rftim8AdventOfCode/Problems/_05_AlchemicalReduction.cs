        /// 
        /// While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better.
        /// You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).
        /// 
        /// The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed.
        /// Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization.For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity,
        /// whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.
        /// 
        /// For example:
        /// 
        /// In aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.
        /// In abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.
        /// In abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.
        /// In aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.
        /// Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:
        /// 
        /// dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA The first 'cC' is removed.
        /// dabAaCBAcCcaDA This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
        /// dabCBAcCcaDA Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
        /// dabCBAcaDA No further actions can be taken.
        /// After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.
        /// 
        /// How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned? (Note: in this puzzle and others, the input is large; if you copy/paste your input,
