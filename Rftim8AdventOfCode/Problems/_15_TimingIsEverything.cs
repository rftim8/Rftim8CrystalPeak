        /// The halls open into an interior plaza containing a large kinetic sculpture.
        /// The sculpture is in a sealed enclosure and seems to involve a set of identical spherical capsules that are carried to the 
        /// top and allowed to bounce through the maze of spinning pieces.
        /// 
        /// Part of the sculpture is even interactive! When a button is pressed, a capsule is dropped and tries to fall through slots 
        /// in a set of rotating discs to finally go through a little hole at the bottom and come out of the sculpture.
        /// If any of the slots aren't aligned with the capsule as it passes, the capsule bounces off the disc and soars away. 
        /// You feel compelled to get one of those capsules.
        /// 
        /// The discs pause their motion each second and come in different sizes; 
        /// they seem to each have a fixed number of positions at which they stop.
        /// You decide to call the position with the slot 0, and count up for each position it reaches next.
        /// 
        /// Furthermore, the discs are spaced out so that after you push the button, one second elapses before the first disc is reached, 
        /// and one second elapses as the capsule passes from one disc to the one below it.
        /// So, if you push the button at time = 100, then the capsule reaches the top disc at time = 101, the second disc at time = 102, the third disc at time = 103, and so on.
        /// 
        /// The button will only drop a capsule at an integer time - no fractional seconds allowed.
        /// 
        /// For example, at time = 0, suppose you see the following arrangement:
        /// 
        /// Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.
        /// Disc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.
        /// If you press the button exactly at time = 0, the capsule would start to fall; it would reach the first disc at time = 1.
        /// Since the first disc was at position 4 at time = 0, by time=1 it has ticked one position forward.
        /// As a five-position disc, the next position is 0, and the capsule falls through the slot.
        /// 
        /// Then, at time = 2, the capsule reaches the second disc. 
        /// The second disc has ticked forward two positions at this point: it started at position 1, then continued to position 0, and finally ended up at position 1 again.
        /// Because there's only a slot at position 0, the capsule bounces away.
        /// 
        /// If, however, you wait until time = 5 to push the button, then when the capsule reaches each disc,
        /// the first disc will have ticked forward 5+1 = 6 times (to position 0), and the second disc will have ticked forward 5+2 = 7 times(also to position 0). 
        /// In this case, the capsule would fall through the discs and come out of the machine.
        /// However, your situation has more than two discs; you've noted their positions in your puzzle input. 
        /// What is the first time you can press the button to get a capsule?
