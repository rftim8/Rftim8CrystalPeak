        /// There's not much to do as you slowly descend to the bottom of the ocean. The submarine computer challenges you to a nice game of Dirac Dice.
        /// 
        /// This game consists of a single die, two pawns, and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked 1 through 10 clockwise.
        /// Each player's starting space is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.
        /// 
        /// Players take turns moving.On each player's turn, the player rolls the die three times and adds up the results.
        /// Then, the player moves their pawn that many times forward around the track 
        /// (that is, moving clockwise on spaces in order of increasing value, wrapping back around to 1 after 10).
        /// So, if a player is on space 7 and they roll 2, 2, and 1, they would move forward 5 times, to spaces 8, 9, 10, 1, and finally stopping on 2.
        /// 
        /// After each player moves, they increase their score by the value of the space their pawn stopped on. Players' scores start at 0.
        /// So, if the first player starts on space 7 and rolls a total of 5, they would stop on space 2 and add 2 to their score (for a total score of 2).
        /// The game immediately ends as a win for any player whose score reaches at least 1000.
        /// 
        /// Since the first game is a practice game, the submarine opens a compartment labeled deterministic dice and a 100-sided die falls out. 
        /// This die always rolls 1 first, then 2, then 3, and so on up to 100, after which it starts over at 1 again.Play using this die.
        /// 
        /// For example, given these starting positions:
        /// 
        /// Player 1 starting position: 4
        /// Player 2 starting position: 8
        /// This is how the game would go:
        /// 
        /// Player 1 rolls 1+2+3 and moves to space 10 for a total score of 10.
        /// Player 2 rolls 4+5+6 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 3.
        /// Player 1 rolls 7+8+9 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 14.
        /// Player 2 rolls 10+11+12 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 9.
        /// Player 1 rolls 13+14+15 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 20.
        /// Player 2 rolls 16+17+18 and moves to space 7 for a total score of 16.
        /// Player 1 rolls 19+20+21 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 26.
        /// Player 2 rolls 22+23+24 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 22.
        /// ...after many turns...
        /// 
        /// Player 2 rolls 82+83+84 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 742.
        /// Player 1 rolls 85+86+87 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 990.
        /// Player 2 rolls 88+89+90 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 745.
