        /// 
        /// Fortunately, someone left a wiring diagram (your puzzle input) that shows how the components are connected.For example:

        /// jqt: rhn xhk nvd
        /// rsh: frs pzl lsr
        /// xhk: hfx

        /// pzl: lsr hfx nvd
        /// qnr: nvd
        /// ntq: jqt hfx bvb xhk
        /// nvd: lhk
        /// lsr: lhk
        /// rzs: qnr cmg lsr rsh
        /// frs: qnr lhk lsr
        /// Each line shows the name of a component, a colon, and then a list of other components to which that component is connected.
        /// Connections aren't directional; abc: xyz and xyz: abc both represent the same configuration.
        /// Each connection between two components is represented only once, so some components might only ever appear on the left or right side
        /// of a colon.
        /// 
        /// In this example, if you disconnect the wire between hfx/pzl, the wire between bvb/cmg, and the wire between nvd/jqt,
        /// you will divide the components into two separate, disconnected groups:
        /// 
        /// 9 components: cmg, frs, lhk, lsr, nvd, pzl, qnr, rsh, and rzs.
        /// 6 components: bvb, hfx, jqt, ntq, rhn, and xhk.
        /// Multiplying the sizes of these groups together produces 54.
