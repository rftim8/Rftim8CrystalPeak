        /// as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

        /// the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.
        /// Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
        /// You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. 
        /// Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.

        /// There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar.
        /// Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?
        ///

        /// 2   5
        /// 1   3
        /// 3   9
        /// 3   3
        /// Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are.
        /// Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.
        /// Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. 
        /// For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.
        /// 
        /// In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:
        /// 
        /// The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
        /// The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
        /// The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
        /// The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
        /// The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
        /// Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.
        /// To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found.
        /// In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!
