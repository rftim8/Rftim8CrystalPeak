        /// The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.

        /// 
        /// Start by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.

        /// F keeps rows 44 through 45.

        /// The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane(numbered 0 through 7). 
        /// The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps.L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.

        /// R means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.
        /// L means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.
