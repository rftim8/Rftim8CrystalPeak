        /// Suddenly, whirling in the distance, you notice what looks like a massive, pixelated hurricane: a deadly spinlock. 
        /// This spinlock isn't just consuming computing power, but memory, too; vast, digital mountains are being ripped from the ground and consumed by the vortex.
        /// 
        /// If you don't move quickly, fixing that printer will be the least of your problems.
        /// 
        /// This spinlock's algorithm is simple but efficient, quickly consuming everything in its path. 
        /// It starts with a circular buffer containing only the value 0, which it marks as the current position.
        /// It then steps forward through the circular buffer some number of steps (your puzzle input) before inserting the first new value, 1, after the value it stopped on.
        /// The inserted value becomes the current position. 
        /// Then, it steps forward from there the same number of steps, and wherever it stops,
        /// inserts after it the second new value, 2, and uses that as the new current position again.
        /// 
        /// It repeats this process of stepping forward, inserting a new value, and using the location of the inserted value as the new current position a total of 2017 times, 
        /// inserting 2017 as its final operation, and ending with a total of 2018 values(including 0) in the circular buffer.
        /// 
        /// For example, if the spinlock were to step 3 times per insert, the circular buffer would begin to evolve like this
        /// (using parentheses to mark the current position after each iteration of the algorithm):
        /// 
        /// (0), the initial state before any insertions.
        /// 0 (1): the spinlock steps forward three times(0, 0, 0), and then inserts the first value, 1, after it. 1 becomes the current position.
        /// 0 (2) 1: the spinlock steps forward three times(0, 1, 0), and then inserts the second value, 2, after it. 2 becomes the current position.
        /// 0  2 (3) 1: the spinlock steps forward three times(1, 0, 2), and then inserts the third value, 3, after it. 3 becomes the current position.
        /// And so on:
        /// 
        /// 0  2 (4) 3  1
        /// 0 (5) 2  4  3  1
        /// 0  5  2  4  3 (6) 1
        /// 0  5 (7) 2  4  3  6  1
        /// 0  5  7  2  4  3 (8) 6  1
        /// 0 (9) 5  7  2  4  3  8  6  1
        /// Eventually, after 2017 insertions, the section of the circular buffer near the last insertion looks like this:
        /// 
        /// 1512  1134  151 (2017) 638  1513  851
