        /// No way, of course, other than building a bridge out of the magnetic components strewn about nearby.

        /// You take an inventory of the components by their port types (your puzzle input).
        /// Each port is identified by the number of pins it uses; more pins mean a stronger connection for your bridge.
        /// A 3/7 component, for example, has a type-3 port on one side, and a type-7 port on the other.
        /// 
        /// Your side of the pit is metallic; a perfect surface to connect a magnetic, zero-pin port.Because of this, the first port you use must be of type 0.
        /// It doesn't matter what type of port you end with; your goal is just to make the bridge as strong as possible.
        /// 
        /// The strength of a bridge is the sum of the port types in each component.
