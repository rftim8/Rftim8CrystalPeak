        /// 
        /// The doors in your current room are either open or closed(and locked) based on the hexadecimal MD5 hash of a passcode(your puzzle input) 
        /// followed by a sequence of uppercase characters representing the path you have taken so far(U for up, D for down, L for left, and R for right).
        /// 
        /// Only the first four characters of the hash are used; they represent, respectively, the doors up, down, left, and right from your current position.
        /// Any b, c, d, e, or f means that the corresponding door is open; any other character(any number or a) means that the corresponding door is closed and locked.
        /// 
        /// To access the vault, all you need to do is reach the bottom-right room; reaching this room opens the vault and all doors in the maze.
        /// 
        /// For example, suppose the passcode is hijkl.Initially, you have taken no steps, and so your path is empty: you simply find the MD5 hash of hijkl alone.

        /// Because you start in the top-left corner, there are no "up" or "left" doors to be open, so your only choice is down.
        /// 
        /// Next, having gone only one step (down, or D), you find the hash of hijklD.This produces f2bc, which indicates that you can go back up, left (but that's a wall), or right.
        /// Going right means hashing hijklDR to get 5745 - all doors closed and locked. 
        /// However, going up instead is worthwhile: even though it returns you to the room you started in, your path would then be DU, opening a different set of doors.
